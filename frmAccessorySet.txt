Hello Smruti,

As discussed in our previous meeting, I noticed a decrease in my DQ Score instead of the expected increase. Initially, my DQ score was 25, and after completing various courses and certifications to enhance my proficiency, it was supposed to increase by 10 points, bringing it to 35. However, I observed a decrease of 5 points, and my current score is displayed as 25 in Compass even after receiving endorsements.

I have successfully improved my skills, and based on the proficiency increase, my overall score should be 40. I would appreciate your prompt assistance in resolving this issue as soon as possible.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
