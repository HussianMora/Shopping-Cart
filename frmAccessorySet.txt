ReadAccessorySets populates the list box (lstAccessorySet) with distinct accessory set descriptions from the "AccessorySets" table.
It checks whether to use ADO or non-ADO (DAO) for database operations based on application configuration.
The list box is cleared before being populated.
Warning messages are displayed if no accessory sets are found in the standard database.
After populating the list box, the ReadAccessorySetCode subroutine is triggered to read and display the code of the selected accessory set.
