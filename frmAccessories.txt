Hello Manikandan Nagarajan,

I'd like to inform you that Manimegalai Chidambaram has assigned me to a new project, DMS. Due to its urgency, she has requested me to commence work on it starting today. Therefore, I will be actively engaged in this project. On another note, I've successfully completed all assignments in App Reengineering POD3 and Desktop Apps POD1. In the event that any tasks arise in these PODs, I will manage them concurrently. I have also communicated this to both POD Leads for coordination.
