Subject: Assistance Requested: DQ Score Not Reflecting Planned Increases

Hello Smruti,

I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a matter regarding my DQ score that requires assistance.

As previously discussed, I had planned to increase my DQ score by 10 points by focusing on two specific skills. I have successfully completed the planned points, but unfortunately, my DQ score has not reflected the expected increase.

Additionally, I have received endorsements, which should contribute an additional 5 points to my DQ score. However, these increases have not been reflected either.

I kindly request your support in addressing this issue and ensuring that my achievements are accurately reflected in my DQ score. If there are any additional steps or information required from my end, please let me know.

Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Husain
