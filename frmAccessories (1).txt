. Procedure Declaration
vba
Copy code
Private Sub Form_Activate()
    ' ... (code not provided in the snippet)
End Sub
Purpose: This event is triggered when the form receives focus and becomes the active form.
2. Variable Declarations
vba
Copy code
Dim bWarn As Boolean
Dim i As Integer
Purpose: Declares two variables, bWarn of type Boolean and i of type Integer, for later use in the procedure.
3. Call to clbCost Subroutine
vba
Copy code
clbCost
Purpose: Calls the clbCost subroutine.
4. Initialization and Warning Check Loop
vba
Copy code
bWarn = False
For i = 2 To NoOfVoltageSystems
    If Val(ReadAPLData(1, 1, "UM")) >= 72.5 And Val(ReadAPLData(i, 1, "UM")) > 18 Then bWarn = True
Next i
Purpose:
Initializes bWarn to False.
Iterates through voltage systems starting from the second one (i = 2).
Uses the ReadAPLData function to retrieve values related to voltage systems.
Checks conditions involving these values.
If the conditions are met, sets bWarn to True.
5. Warning Message Display
vba
Copy code
If bWarn Then
    addMessage "If DIN-porcelain bushings are used then semi-conductive layer is needed for porcelain bottom part because of PD-test.", MESSAGETYPE_WARNING
End If
Purpose: If bWarn is True, displays a warning message using the addMessage subroutine.
